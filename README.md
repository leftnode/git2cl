# git2cl
Turn your git commit logs to a change log

# Usage
* Copy the git2cl PHP file to your $PATH.
* sudo chmod +x git2cl
* From any directory, `git2cl /path/to/repo`. However this will create a file named ChangeLog in the directory you're in.
* You can go to the repo directory and do `git2cl .` there to create the ChangeLog file with your Git repository.
