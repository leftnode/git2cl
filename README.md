### git2cl
Turn your git commit logs to a single ChangeLog file in your repository.

### Usage
* Copy the *git2cl* PHP file to your $PATH. Ensure it's executable.
* From any directory, `git2cl /path/to/repo > /path/to/ChangeLog`.
* Executing `git2cl > /path/to/ChangeLog` works as well, and assumes `.` as the repository directory.
