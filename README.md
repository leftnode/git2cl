### git2cl
Turn your git commit logs to a single ChangeLog file in your repository.

### Usage
* Copy the git2cl PHP file to your $PATH.
* sudo chmod +x git2cl
* From any directory, `git2cl /path/to/repo`. This will create a file named **ChangeLog** in `/path/to/repo`.
* Executing `git2cl` works as well, and assumes `.` as the repository directory.
